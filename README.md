Resources for learning Quantum Computing.

This is the source for the site hosted on Githup pages.
https://stevefroehlich.github.io/

The purpose is to create tools for people interested in learning
about Quantum Computing. There is a lot of great content online
that people can learn from. The intent of this effort is to create
problems, tests and solutions where people can verify what they know.
This is born from the frustration of reading a text book and having 
no idea what you actually retained. This is an attempt to solve that
problem.

The solution involves two parts. First website that provides problems 
for a concept. Then toggles for the answer to the problem as well as 
the steps taken to get to that answer. Those steps are referred to as 
the solution. The second part is links to a subreddit where people can
ask questions when they get stuck. There is also a subreddit for people
to post content like lectures, books or other resources which helps 
teach the material the problem is pertaining to.

If you are interested in contributing you can copy some of the existing
pages source and create pages for other content or add problems to existing
pages.
